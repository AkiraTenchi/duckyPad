Congratulations on your new toy! Here is a short guide on how to use your duckyPad.

## Kit Assembly

If your duckyPad has not been assembled yet, [see this guide](/kit_assembly_guide.md) to put it together.

## Quick Start

Your duckyPad should come with a SD card already installed, containing some demo profiles.

Simply plug it into your computer, and voilÃ :

![Alt text](resources/pics/firefox_example.JPG)

* Use `+` and `-` button to switch profiles.

* Press a key to execute the corresponding script. Hold it down to repeat.

* Hold down `+` or `-` button to change RGB LED brightness.

* If you use `AZERTY` or `Dvorak` layout, **`HOLD DOWN TOP LEFT KEY`** while **`PLUGGING IT IN`**, then select your layout.

## Customizing Your Own Scripts

Chances are you want to write your own scripts. So here's how! 

### Notes on SD Card

* It is recommended to unplug your duckyPad before handling the SD card.

* To remove the SD card, push inwards to unlock.

* To install the SD card, insert logo side up, push until it clicks in place:

* If you decide to use your own SD card, it should be formatted in [FAT32 format](resources/pics/format.PNG).

### Download the duckyPad configurator

[Head here to download the latest release](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/releases) for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

* The software is in early stages of development. If you run into any problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckypad/issues), ask in the [official duckyPad discord](https://discord.gg/4sJCBx5), DM me on discord `dekuNukem#6998`, or contact me through `dekuNukem`@`gmail`.`com`.

Extract the `.zip` file and launch the application by clicking `duckypad_config.exe`:

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/duckexe.png)

For Linux users, simply run the `duckypad_config.py` script with Python3.6 or higher. 

### "Untrusted App" Warnings

When trying to run the app, your system might complain about this software being untrusted. This is because I haven't had the code digitally signed, which costs hundreds of dollars a year.

Please feel free to [review the code](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/tree/master/pc_software). If you really don't trust the app, you can run the `duckypad_config.py` script itself with Python3. Finally, you can [configure your duckyPad completely manually](#Configure-duckyPad-Manually).

For Windows 10, click `More info` and then `Run anyway`.

For macOS, **`RIGHT CLICK`** on the app and select `Open`:

### Using the duckyPad configurator

Mount the SD card on your computer and launch the app. It should look like this:

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/unselected.png)

Press the `Open...` button, and select the **`entire SD card`**:

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/select_root.png)

The application should load up the data from the SD card:

It might look a bit overwhelming, but don't worry, let's break it down.

* The leftmost column is for *profiles*.

* Each profile contains a group of scripts corresponding to the keys on the duckyPad.

* As you can see, you typically create a profile for each app you want to control.

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/profiles.png)

* Use the buttons to create a new profile, duplicate an existing profile, and remove/rename a profile.

* Use the up/down arrow button to reorder profiles.

* Choose a background color for the RGB backlight.

* `Activation color` is the color that a key change into when you press it. On `Auto` it would be the inverse of background color, you can also choose one yourself.

* By default unused keys are dimmed, you can override this by unticking the checkbox.

-----

The middle column is for *keys*:

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/keys.png)

* Here you can configure the 15 keys on your duckyPad.

* Click a key to select it.

* Type to give it a name, or click `Remove` to delete it.

* You can assign an unique color to each key, or use the same color as background.

* Drag a key to rearrange its order.

-----

Finally, the rightmost column is for *scripts*:

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/scripts.png)

* Once you have selected a key, the script that this key will execute is displayed here.

* duckyPad uses duckyScript, please [read about its usage here](duckyscript_info.md).

* Code check will be performed as you type, errors will be highlighted in yellow.

* Press `Run this script!` button to test-run it on your computer. **`MAKE SURE YOU TRUST THE SCRIPT!`**

* Test-run starts after a 2-second delay.

* Test-run can't get past [Windows User Account Control](resources/pics/app/uac.png) screens. You'll have to run it on real thing.

* On macOS, if test-run doesn't work, [go to Settings -> Security & Privacy -> Accessibility](resources/pics/app/macos.png), unlock and allow the app. Even then, some key combos might not work. Better test it on the real thing.

-----

One the bottom we have settings and updates section.

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/settings.png)

By default, duckyPad goes to sleep after 30 minutes. Adjust the slider to set your own delay. Drag it all the way left for always-on.

`Updates` section shows available updates for this app and duckyPad firmware. Click on the text for instructions.

-----

Don't forget to save!

![Alt text](resources/pics/app/save.png)

* Press the `Save` button to save the changes to SD card. It might take a few seconds.

* You can also press `Save as...` to make a backup somewhere else, select a empty folder first!

### Run it!

Eject the SD card from your computer, insert it into duckyPad, plug it in. It should start up and display the profile names and key names, as well as the customized colors.

Press the corresponding keys to execute the scripts, if there is an error it will show up on the screen.

Press +/- button to change profiles.

## Using Autohotkey

You can use [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) for even more sophisticated scripting needs, such as launching apps/scripts, control mouse moments, etc.

To do this, duckyPad can be set up to press a simple combo like `WIN + F1`, which then get captured by autohotkey to execute a more complex custom script on your PC.

* Download and install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com)

* Download and save [this sample autohotkey script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/master/resources/duckypad_autohotkey_script.ahk) as an `.ahk` file.

* Switch the profile on duckyPad to [`autohotkey`](sample_profiles/profile7_autohotkey), and run the script by right clicking and select `Run Script`.

![Alt text](resources/pics/ahk_run.png)

* AHK will execute the script. Press any key on duckyPad, a corresponding message box will appear.

![Alt text](resources/pics/ahk_box.png)

* Now you can write your own autohotkey script to do whatever you want!

Check out the [official tutorials](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs_1.0/Tutorial.htm), the [autohotkey profile](sample_profiles/profile7_autohotkey), and the [sample autohotkey script](resources/duckypad_autohotkey_script.ahk) upon which you can tinker with.

## macOS shortcuts

You can also create custom keyboard shortcuts on macOS. [See this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2271/mac).

For more advanced scripting needs, you can try [bettertouchtool](https://folivora.ai), which can be considered macOS equivalent of autohotkey.

## USB Firmware Updates

You can update duckyPad's firmware via USB, for bug fixes and and/or new features. 

[Please see this guide](./firmware_updates_and_version_history.md).

## Configure duckyPad Manually

If you don't trust or unable to run the software, you can also configure duckyPad manually.

[Please see this guide](./manual_setup.md).
