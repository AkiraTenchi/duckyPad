# kbord: Scriptable Mechanical Keypad with RGB Backlight

![Alt text](resources/pics/title.jpg)

kbord is a mechanical keypad with OLED screen and 15 keys, each of which can execute a script when pressed.

The script can be as simple as shortcuts like `ctrl+c`, or as complex as [creating root backdoors](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---OSX-Root-Backdoor) or [grabbing passwords](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---download-mimikatz%2C-grab-passwords-and-email-them-via-gmail).

Multiple profiles are supported, for different programs/environments.

## Features

* 15 mechanical switches
* Individually addressable RGB backlights with animations
* OLED screen displaying current profile and key functions
* SD card script storage
* USB-C connector
* Standard duckyscript parsed onboard
