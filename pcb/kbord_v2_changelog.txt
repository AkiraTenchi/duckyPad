DONE:
moved header to board edge for easier programming
the 5-pin header is compatible with daytripper pogo board
removed rotary encoder
added gate enable signal pulldown to prevent flashing during programming
moved SD card inwards and upwards
added OLED ribbon cable connector, no need to solder the flexible PCB anymore
changed to USBC connector
small button for RST and DFU
moved the screen up a bit
OLED_RESET is now on PA0
BUTTON1 and BUTTON2 are now on PA1 and PA2 respectively
added stabilizer holes to cherry MX switch footprints
used a new button with plastic cap to prevent ESD

TODO:
remove ADC to save some space
write a test mode
use the same white button of DFU/RST for plus minus

NOTES:
oled socket midpoint: 7.25mm
oled socket pos (mil): 2860 1890
print project url on screen if error encountered
clean up ducky parser, looks like a lot of alias wasn't included, like "ESC" and "ESCAPE", "CTRL" or "CONTROL", etc
find blank keycap with indent?
no back plate, rubber feet on PCB, piece of paper tape over OLED ribbon cable?

what are those for?
const char cmd_NAME[] = "NAME ";
const char cmd_REPLAY[] = "REPLAY ";
